A collective of my machine learning lessons done while going along with [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/)

## Jupyter Notebook
I am using jupyter notebook to follow along with exercises and project provided in this book (it was recommended by author to use jupyter)
